<p>I enjoyed this week the most out of all of the projects.  All of the concepts came together for me this week and I feel a bit more confident about javascript.  I feel that if I had more time, I would have been able to finish all 12 of the functions, the the array ones looked more difficult.  It is obvious that I will need to continue practicing with javascript.</p>
