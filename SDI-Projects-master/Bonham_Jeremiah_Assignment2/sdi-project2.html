<p>Unlike Project 1, this story will not be about Zombies.  I feel that there would not be the right type of data to use in that to create all of the variables that I would need to complete this week's assignment</p>
<p>I played a game called World of Warcraft for many years.  I was an officer in a guild and helped to put Raid groups together.  If unfamiliar with this concept, a Raid is a group of players that get together to try to complete an dungeon.  There are 10 person, 25 person, and 40 person Raids.  Tanks are the most heavily armored characters that keep the enemy focused on them.  DPS, or Damage per Second, are the character who need to kill the enemy.  Healeres, as the name inplies, heals the Raid.  Buffs are short term enhancments for characters.</p>
<p>The outcome of my code should yeild the proper group type for an average 10 person Raid.</p>
